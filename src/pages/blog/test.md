## Interesting blog post

*Authored by GreenArron#4062 and co-authored by Enoki#1821*

I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin

I don’t know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it’s my way of dealing with
stress or something but I just do it about once every week. Generally I’ll carry
around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position making goblin
noises, then I’ll walk around my house and pick up various different “trinkets”
and put them in my bag while saying stuff like “I’ll be having that” and laughing
maniacally in my goblin voice (“trinkets” can include anything from shit I find
on the ground to cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was talking with my
neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote about and I
was just internally screaming the entire conversation. I’m 99% sure they don’t
know it’s me but god that 1% chance is seriously weighing on my mind.
